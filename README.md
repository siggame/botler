## FAQ

1 ) When is MegaMinerAI?

- Glad you asked! MegaMinerAI20 is November 11th of fall 2017 and will go on till November 12th.

2 ) When are the General Meetings?

- Great question. The General Meetings are every Wednesday at 5pm in the Computer Science building, Room 207. 
  Remember, if you want to compete in the Megaminer competition for money please do not come to any of the 
  General Meetings past September 20th as we will be creating the game. Got more detailed questions? Talk to a lead! They won't bite most of the time. ;)

3 ) Which lead is mine, or which lead does what?

- This my friend is a great question. The current leads and their sections are:

  - Quincy Conduff: Arena
  - Matthew Qualls: Visualizer
  - Chris Kinney: Game
  - Michael Beaver: Web
  - Reno DuBois: Web
  - Shawn McCormick: AI
  - Cody Roberts: Public Relations (PR)

  All leads are available in the SIG-Game Private Discord.

4 ) When are the lead meetings?

- This is a tricky one. Each lead is in charge of scheduling their own team meetings. Because of various changes it is best to ask them.
  If you are confused who to contact, please ask the question above for a list of leads and what they do. If you have any more detailed questions PLEASE do not be scared to ask them. They are really nice I promise. :)

5 ) What is SIG-Game about?

- Sister lemme tell you something, that is one of the more important questions I have heard all day.
  SIG-Game is a Special Interest Group (SIG) that focuses on developing playable games for Artificial Intelligence.
  Most of our work is directed at the end of semester competition called MegaMinerAI which is a 24 hour coding competition where people come from far and wide to battle AIs. The game is meant for people to develop an AI with the intention of battling it against other people's AIs in the game arena. The whole thing is able to be watched by a little something called the Visulizer, an interface that plays the game with all the graphics so you can watch the bots in action. Don't worry about if you think it's too hard because it's not! There are plenty of people around to help and students of all levels are winning. You should join whether you want to be a developer, competitor, or just want to watch. Though if you are a developer you cannot compete for the prizes just so you know. The prize is usually money but they don't tell me anything these days so you will have to ask them more details if you are still curious. If you have anymore detailed questions please feel free to ask in the general chat!

6 ) I don't see my question you silly bot.

- *spits out soda* Aww you just called me silly. You just run over to the General chat and ask a lead about your question you pretty thing. <3

## Usage

-To run vivi, cd into the src file, then run 'npm run build' 'node app.js'
-Vivi will run until you ctrl-c out of the process
-Its probably not a good idea run it when it already running. You should check Discord to see if it is already up
